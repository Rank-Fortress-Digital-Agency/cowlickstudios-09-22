                    1. Mobile-Responsiveness
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People who have a negative user experience on their mobile devices are <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/app-and-mobile/mobile-site-speed-tools-load-time/">62% less likely</a> to make a future purchase. Even a second-long delay in load times can hurt your conversion rate by 20%.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If your website isn’t mobile-ready, you’ll miss the chance to attract potential customers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, run your site through Google’s Mobile-Friendly Test. If it’s not mobile-ready or responsive, work with an experienced design team. They can help improve your site so it’s easy to use on mobile devices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consumers check their phones every day to find nearby businesses. Imagine a client whose car breaks down a mile from your shop. A quick Google search could point them in your direction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In fact, 75% of smartphone users open a search engine first to address immediate needs. About 76% of those customers visit a business within a day. About 30% of all mobile searches are related to location.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Don’t neglect your on-the-go customers. Learning how to design a car repair website with responsiveness in mind can help you reach new clients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If your competitors haven’t updated their websites yet, now’s your chance to get in the lead!

                    2. Search Engine Optimization
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You’ll also need a mobile-ready website as part of your search engine optimization or SEO strategy. Google will look at the mobile version of your site first to determine your search rankings. Higher search engine rankings can boost your brand’s visibility online.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can rank ahead of competing home inspection business’ to ensure your site appears in front of clients first.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As part of your SEO strategy, you need to consider your auto repair website design, development, and content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, too many page elements can cause your site to lag. Visitors might leave feeling frustrated if your site is slow. Your bounce rate will increase as a result.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If Google notices your pages have a high bounce rate, it might decide to drop your rankings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You’ll also need to make sure your site appeals to Google’s Core Web Vitals. These user-centric ranking factors consider the user’s online experience. For example, you’ll need to make sure your site is secure with an SSL certificate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also optimize your content by targeting specific words and phrases. When consumers search for those phrases online, your automotive repair website could appear.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consider working with an experienced design and development agency. They can help you apply website design ideas that will boost your organic rankings. Then, you can generate more traffic and leads!

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        As you continue applying these website design tips, try to minimize your use of stock photos. It’s important to create a strong first impression. Unfortunately, people are having an easier time recognizing stock photos.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Stock photos might make your brand look in-genuine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Instead, use high-quality photos of your actual home inspection business. Consider hiring a professional photographer to take photos for you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        High-quality, branded photos can help consumers connect with your brand. They add a personal touch that can help you stand out from competitors, too.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Consider adding a before and after photo gallery to your website. Before and after photos can help prove your skillset. Consumers will recognize they can trust you with their auto repair needs.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once you start generating website traffic, you need a way to convert those visitors into leads and sales. Add more than one conversion opportunity across your site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, add an eye-catching button to the navigation bar encouraging visitors to book an appointment or contact you. You can also add a click-to-call button for mobile users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Otherwise, look at the forms on your site. Try to reduce how many fields you feature on each form. Instead, make sure users can quickly complete the form to reach you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also add a lead magnet (like an eBook) and email newsletter subscription form to your site. Then, use email marketing to engage clients. Email marketing will help keep your home inspection business top of mind.

                    As you build a home inspection business website, it’s important to make sure your pages aren’t too cluttered. Cluttered pages can overwhelm visitors. They won’t know which way to turn.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead, use white space to give your content room to breathe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Make sure the navigation bar is organized and easy to use. If visitors struggle to find the information they need, they might leave.
